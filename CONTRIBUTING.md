Contributing
------------

If you want to make changes to the API, add a major new feature, or fix a bug, please consider opening a GitHub
issue first to discuss the changes. Small bug fixes don't need an issue and can just be addressed in a pull request.

As a general rule, pull requests for which the tests don't pass will not be reviewed. If you have trouble getting
tests to pass, please indicate so on the pull request.

Other than that, happy hacking!
