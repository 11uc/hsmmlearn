- If you're reporting a bug, check that you've included your 
  - Python version
  - Platform (mac OS/Linux/Windows/...)
  as well as any other factors that may be relevant (e.g. version of MSVC used to compile the C++ extensions).
- If you're reporting a problem with the inference, please include a minimal working example that demonstrates
  the issue. If constructing such an example is difficult, feel free to open an issue nonetheless but keep in
  mind that reproducing (and fixing) the issue may be a lot harder.
