hsmmlearn
=========

hsmmlearn is a library for **unsupervised** learning of hidden semi-Markov
models with explicit durations. It is a port of the
[hsmm package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hsmm/) for R, and in
fact wraps the same underlying C++ library.

hsmmlearn borrows its name and the design of its api from
[hmmlearn](http://hmmlearn.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
